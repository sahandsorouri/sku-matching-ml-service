## Overview

This ML service ingests raw, duplicate-heavy retail item listings and returns the matched canonical SKU ID using a hybrid of LightGBM classification and fastText-based semantic embeddings. The system includes real-time API access, caching, and a human-in-the-loop verification mechanism during early-stage training.

---

## Problem

Retail datasets often include massive amounts of:
- Duplicated SKUs with inconsistent naming
- Vendor-specific spelling, abbreviations, or formatting
- Noisy entries in local food & beverage inventories

Our dataset contained over **6 million items**, many of which were repeated with variations.

Manual cleanup at this scale was inefficient and error-prone.

---

## Solution

We built a **FastAPI-based service** that leverages:
- **fastText embeddings** to convert item names to vectors
- A **LightGBM classifier** trained on pairwise similarity scores
- **Similarity thresholding (80%)** to flag near-matches
- A **human-in-the-loop review** system for early training refinement
- **Redis caching** to accelerate inference
- Scheduled retraining via **Airflow**

## My Role

I led this project as the **Product Manager**, collaborating with a team of data scientists.

- Initiated the project based on repeated internal pain points
- Designed the human-in-the-loop feedback loop
- Defined success metrics and MVP cutoffs
- Aligned stakeholders and oversaw model iteration cycles
